## What is object-oriented programming?

It is a programming model or Principle in which we organize our Classes(Software Design) around objects(Can be real-life objects like cars, humans etc.) rather than the traditional procedural approach where we use functions.

## What are the main 4 pillars of object-oriented programming? 

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

## Explain each with an example.

- Encapsulation - It is the method of bundling the related data (i.e. Attributes of a Class) with the methods(i.e. functions of a class) used to work with that data.
For Example:
In real life, a car has attributes like make, model, etc. and functions like accelerate, brake, turn etc.
Now when we create a class like a car with the necessary attributes and combine the class with necessary functions like brake, turn etc. That is a form of encapsulation
- Inheritance - It is the method of deriving a class(Child) from another class(Parent) that shares a set of attributes and functions. 
For Example:
A car can be derived/inherited from a vehicle as the car needs to have all the properties of a vehicle, but a vehicle doesn't need to have all the properties of a car.
- Polymorphism - It is the method by which functions of class produce different results depending on the Function Signature(parameter and return value).
For Example:
When you copy a text and paste it somewhere else you are using Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, Now if you are copying a file from one folder to another, you are still pressing Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, but the outcome is different.
- Abstraction  - It is the method of restricting the user to required information and functionality and hiding all the unnecessary information and functionality.
For Example:
You can start a car by pressing the start button. You don't need to know how to start the engine properly. The car's internal process of starting the car is completely hidden.
